8. Configure GitHub Pages
Navigate to the GitHub Pages settings page
In your web browser, navigate to the GitHub repository
Above the code browser, click on the tab labeled "Settings"
In the sidebar, in the "Code and automation" section, click on "Pages"
Configure the "Build and deployment" settings like this:
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch:
Branch: gh-pages
Folder: / (root)
Click on the "Save" button
That's it! The React app has been deployed to GitHub Pages! ðŸš€

At this point, the React app is accessible to anyone who visits the homepage URL you specified in Step 4. For example, the React app I deployed is accessible at https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages.

9. (Optional) Store the React app's source code on GitHub
In a previous step, the gh-pages npm package pushed the distributable version of the React app to a branch named gh-pages in the GitHub repository. However, the source code of the React app is not yet stored on GitHub.

In this step, I'll show you how you can store the source code of the React app on GitHub.

Commit the changes you made while you were following this tutorial, to the master branch of the local Git repository; then, push that branch up to the master branch of the GitHub repository.

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Configure React app for deployment to GitHub Pages"
$ git push origin master
I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. It will have two branches: master and gh-pages. The master branch will contain the React app's source code, while the gh-pages branch will contain the distributable version of the React app.
